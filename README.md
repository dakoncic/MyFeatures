#Introduction
We could agree that we all write some notes and "to do" lists, from personal to proffesional life: ideas, new years goals,
finances, summer vacation list and all sorts of information we need to remember.
We keep it in different ways, either in notepad or/and through some phone app.

But of course, we do not write absolutely everything that we plan to do because it's easy to remember,
for example repeating chores like: washing car, cleaning our apartment,
calling our grandparents more often, planning to read more books or to exercise consistently.\
And at least in my case, here is the problem, I postpone it, forget and say: "I will do it tommorrow".

I noticed I am more productive when I create plan for the day ahead and even week what I have to do and should do, but writing
"to do" lists manually over and over again is repetitive task which becomes annoying after some time
and then I'm right at the beginning.\
I know what I have to do, but then again I don't do it unless it's really urgent.

The main question is, how I can be more productive and disciplined with less trying, if I can automate it,
so it's always in front of me to remind me, like a personal assistant.

I know if I want something done right, I need to do it myself, so I decided to create application which will perfectly suit my needs
to better organize day to day activities.

#Life organizer app
Web Application is created which helps with organizing life.
There is only one page and it consists of 4 main features:
1. 7 days schedule (including today) of committed tasks for each day that need to be resolved
2. "One time" main group of uncomitted tasks which need to be resolved only once like:\
    - research which solar panels I need
    - research best investing options for retirement
3. "Repeating" group of uncomitted tasks which are repeating:
    - exercise every other day
    - read at least 30 minutes each day
    - work at least 45 minutes each day on personal project outside work
    - listen at least 30 minutes of podcast every other day
4. Notepads
    we can can create as many notepads we want, and write in them general information
    of everything we wish to remember which are not necesseraly tasks, like: 
    - our budgets
    - lists of items we will pack for vacation
    - all summarized important information when buying new video survailance for example
    - wish list of items we want to buy in future

Each task can optionally have a due date (deadline), and when date comes within 7 days, it will be automatically be committed in
schedule for next 7 days.\
Repeating tasks upon completion can optionally automatically be created again with specified range of days or months in between,
for example: we can create repeating task to remind us for car registration, after completion, it will remind is in 12 months again.\
Those that don't have deadline, we can still commit them to certain day for the next 7 days schedule.\
Each committed task can be returned to it's own original group (One time or Repeating).\
Both committed items in the next 7 days schedule and original groups can be sorted so we can better focus on priorities first.\

We all deal with setbacks but in the long run, the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits."
