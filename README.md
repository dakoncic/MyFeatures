# My Features App

Introduction
We could agree that we all write some notes and "to do" lists, from personal to proffesional life: repeating chores, ideas, plans for the future,
marriage anniversaries, birthdays, finances, summer vacation list and all sorts of information we need to remember.
We keep it in different ways, either in notepad or/and through some phone app.

Entering our adult life, those lists and notes just keep getting bigger and bigger, we have more obligations and responsibilities.
As they keep growing, we have to organize them, group them, order them by priorities to not get overwhelmed.

I noticed I am more productive when I create plan for the day ahead and even week what I have to do and should do, but writing
"to do" lists over and over again is repetitive task which becomes annoying after some time.
